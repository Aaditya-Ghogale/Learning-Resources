    this was a type of polymorphism 
    there are 2 types of polymorphism in java:
    1. Compile - time polymorphism (also known as static polymorphism) because it  is resolved during compile time.
    2. Runtime polymorphism (also known as dynamic polymorphism) because it is resolved during the runtime 
    Above is an example of compile-time polymorphism, also known as method overloading.
    here the methods are of same name but with different parameters.

SO THE PRESENCE OF THE @Override ANNOTATION DOES NOT CHANGE THE OUTPUT, BUT IT IS A GOOD PRACTICE TO USE IT AS IT HELPS IN CODE READABILITY AND MAINTENANCE.
ðŸ”’ With @Override, you're protected against:
Typos

Wrong parameter lists

Mistakes in inheritance

Bugs that are hard to track down
