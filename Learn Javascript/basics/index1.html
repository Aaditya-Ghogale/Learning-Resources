<!-- We can put the script tag anywhere in  the head or body -->
<!-- But the best practice is to put it at the lower end of the document  -->
<!-- As the browser parses a document from top to end so when it does it results in  bad user experience  -->
<!-- If the script is a top as it wwould take time to parse -->
<!-- And the below html elements will not be loaded  while browser will be  busy parsing-->
<!-- And this will make the site look slow-----resultng in ba user exp -->


<!-- Reason 2--- almost all time javascript is doing something by interacting with some eleement in the html  -->
<!-- So if we put the script at the end of the document then the html elements will be loaded and ready to be interacted with -->
 <!-- And we can make sure to display elemnts as reqd -->
<!-- As sometimes we need to hide some elements -->
 <!-- And be sure all elements are rendered  -->
