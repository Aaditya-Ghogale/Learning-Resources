Here’s a consolidated “final sheet” focused on theory first—so you can nail the interview—followed by a concise list of practical exercises you can sprinkle in as time allows.

## A. Theory Primer (Priority)

### 1. Cloud Computing Fundamentals  
- **Definition**: On‑demand delivery of compute, storage, networking, databases, and software over the Internet on a pay‑as‑you‑go basis.  
- **Service Models**  
  - **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service): Virtualized resources  
    - AWS → EC2 | GCP → Compute Engine  
  - **PaaS** (Platform as a Service): Managed platforms for app dev  
    - AWS → Elastic Beanstalk | GCP → App Engine  
  - **SaaS** (Software as a Service): Subscription‑based applications  
    - Examples: Google Workspace, Office 365  

### 2. Global Infrastructure  
- **Regions & Zones**  
  - AWS: Regions → multiple AZs for redundancy  
  - GCP: Regions → multiple zones; global VPC spans regions  
- **Edge PoPs**  
  - AWS: CloudFront Edge Locations  
  - GCP: Cloud CDN Points of Presence  

### 3. Core Services Deep Dive  
| Category      | AWS Service               | GCP Service                     | Purpose                                          |
|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Compute**   | EC2, Lambda               | Compute Engine, Cloud Functions | VMs & serverless event‑driven functions          |
| **Storage**   | S3, EBS                   | Cloud Storage, Persistent Disk  | Object & block storage                           |
| **Networking**| VPC, ELB                  | VPC, Cloud Load Balancing       | Isolated networks & traffic distribution         |
| **Database**  | RDS, DynamoDB             | Cloud SQL, Firestore            | Managed relational & NoSQL databases             |
| **IAM**       | IAM                       | IAM                             | Identity & access management                     |
| **Monitoring**| CloudWatch                | Operations Suite                | Metrics, logs, alarms                            |

### 4. Networking & Security  
- **VPC Fundamentals**  
  - AWS: Subnets, Route Tables, IGW, NAT Gateway  
  - GCP: Global VPC with regional subnets  
- **Firewalls & ACLs**  
  - AWS: Security Groups (stateful), Network ACLs (stateless)  
  - GCP: VPC Firewall Rules with priority settings  
- **VPN Connectivity**  
  - AWS: AWS VPN (Site‑to‑Site, Client VPN)  
  - GCP: Cloud VPN  
- **IAM Best Practices**  
  - Principle of Least Privilege, Roles vs. Policies, Service Accounts  

### 5. Linux Fundamentals  
- **Key Commands**: `top`, `htop`, `netstat`/`ss`, `lsof`, `df`/`du`, `ps`, `grep`, `awk`  
- **Bash Scripting**: Variables, loops, conditionals, functions  
- **Log Analysis**: `tail -f`, `journalctl`, `/var/log/syslog`  

### 6. Database Administration  
- **Operations**: Create DBs/users; grant permissions; import/export data  
- **Backup & Recovery**  
  - AWS RDS: Automated backups, snapshots, point‑in‑time recovery  
  - GCP Cloud SQL: Automated backups, PITR  
- **LDAP User Management**: Bind DN, group membership, syncing  

### 7. Monitoring & Incident Response  
- **Monitoring Tools**  
  - AWS: CloudWatch (metrics, logs, alarms)  
  - GCP: Operations Suite (formerly Stackdriver)  
  - Nagios/Zabbix (on‑premise hybrid)  
- **Incident Playbook**  
  - Alert thresholds → notification → escalation  
  - Runbook template: Symptoms → Diagnosis → Remediation → Post‑mortem  

### 8. Additional Key Topics  
- **Infrastructure as Code**  
  - Terraform vs. CloudFormation vs. Deployment Manager  
- **Cost Management**  
  - AWS Cost Explorer / GCP Billing Reports; budgets & alerts  
- **Containers & Orchestration (15 min intro)**  
  - Docker basics; EKS vs. GKE overview

## B. Practical Exercises (Sparingly)  
1. **Spin up a VM**  
   - AWS EC2 and GCP Compute Engine: launch, SSH in, install Apache.  
2. **Object Storage**  
   - Create an S3 bucket & GCP Storage bucket; upload/download objects.  
3. **VPC & Security**  
   - Build a VPC with two subnets; attach a Security Group/Firewall Rule.  
4. **Simple Runbook Drill**  
   - Trigger a CloudWatch alarm (e.g., high CPU) and walk through your runbook steps.
