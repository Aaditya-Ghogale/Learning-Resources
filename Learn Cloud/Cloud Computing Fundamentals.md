# 1. Cloud Computing Fundamentals

>1. What is the “on‑demand delivery” model that defines cloud computing?  

The **"on-demand delivery"** model in cloud computing allows organizations to access IT resources—such as computing power, storage, and databases—over the internet as needed, without the necessity of owning physical infrastructure. This approach enables businesses to scale resources up or down based on demand, paying only for what they use, which enhances flexibility and cost-efficiency.

**Key Features of On-Demand Delivery:**

1. **Pay-As-You-Go Pricing:** Organizations are billed based on actual usage of resources, avoiding large upfront investments in hardware and reducing overall IT costs.

2. **Scalability and Flexibility:** Cloud services can be rapidly scaled to accommodate fluctuating workloads, ensuring that businesses have the necessary resources during peak times without overprovisioning. 

3. **Accessibility:** Resources are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, facilitating remote work and global collaboration. 

4. **Managed Services:** Many cloud providers offer additional managed services, such as infrastructure management, security, and compliance, allowing organizations to focus more on their core business activities. 

**Real-World Example:**

A software development startup can utilize on-demand cloud computing to deploy and test applications without investing in physical servers. They can provision virtual servers and storage through a cloud provider's self-service portal, configure them as needed, and pay only for the resources consumed during the testing period. This approach minimizes expenses and optimizes resource utilization. 

By leveraging the on-demand delivery model, organizations can enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and respond swiftly to changing market demands.




>2. Which five categories of IT resources are typically delivered “as a service” in the cloud?  
 
The five core categories of IT resources typically delivered "as a service" in cloud computing are:

1. **Compute**  
   Virtual machines and containers used to process data and run applications.  
   *Example: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine*

2. **Storage**  
   On-demand data storage solutions, including file, object, and block storage.  
   *Example: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage*

3. **Networking**  
   Services that allow secure and efficient data transmission, including load balancing, DNS, and VPN.  
   *Example: AWS VPC, GCP Virtual Private Cloud*

4. **Databases**  
   Fully managed relational and NoSQL database services.  
   *Example: Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL*

5. **Software**  
   Applications delivered over the internet via a subscription model.  
   *Example: Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365*

These services are delivered on a **pay-as-you-go** basis, enabling businesses to scale efficiently without managing physical infrastructure.



>3. How does the “pay‑as‑you‑go” pricing model work in cloud computing?  
 
The **pay‑as‑you‑go** pricing model in cloud computing means you **only pay for the resources you use**, and **only for as long as you use them**.

### 🔍 Key Points:
- **No upfront costs**: You don’t need to buy hardware or sign long-term contracts.
- **Billing is based on usage**: You are charged per second, minute, or hour for compute, storage, bandwidth, etc.
- **Automatic scaling**: As demand increases or decreases, your usage (and cost) adjusts accordingly.
- **Service-specific rates**: Each service (like EC2, S3, RDS) has its own pricing tiers and models.

### 📌 Example:
If you launch an EC2 instance and run it for 5 hours, you are charged **only for those 5 hours**, based on the instance type’s hourly rate. When you stop or terminate it, billing stops.

This model provides **cost-efficiency** and **financial flexibility**, especially for startups or workloads with unpredictable demand.




>4. What are the three primary cloud service models?

The three main cloud service models are **IaaS**, **PaaS**, and **SaaS**. Each offers different levels of abstraction, flexibility, and control over the computing resources you use.

---

## 🧱 1. IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service
**Definition**:  
IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. You rent IT infrastructure—servers, storage, networking, and virtualization—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.

**Features**:
- Most flexible
- Ideal for sysadmins and DevOps teams
- You manage: OS, middleware, apps
- Provider manages: hardware, storage, networking

**Use Cases**:
- Hosting websites
- Creating virtual machines
- Running custom business applications

**Examples**:
- **AWS**: EC2, EBS, VPC
- **GCP**: Compute Engine, Persistent Disks
- **Azure**: Virtual Machines

---

## ⚙️ 2. PaaS – Platform as a Service
**Definition**:  
PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure.

**Features**:
- Focus on app development, not infrastructure
- You manage: your application code and data
- Provider manages: OS, runtime, storage, networking

**Use Cases**:
- Rapid application development
- API management
- Backend services for web and mobile apps

**Examples**:
- **AWS**: Elastic Beanstalk
- **GCP**: App Engine
- **Azure**: App Service

---

## 🧑‍💼 3. SaaS – Software as a Service
**Definition**:  
SaaS delivers software applications over the internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. Users don’t manage or control the underlying infrastructure.

**Features**:
- Fully managed by the vendor
- Accessible via web browsers
- Often multi-tenant (shared with other customers)

**Use Cases**:
- Email and productivity tools
- CRM and collaboration platforms
- File storage and sharing

**Examples**:
- Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs, Drive)
- Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Excel, Teams)
- Salesforce, Dropbox, Zoom

These models help organizations choose how much control and responsibility they want to retain versus offload to a provider.



>5. How do these models differ in terms of customer responsibility vs. provider responsibility?  

## 🧱 IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

**Customer is responsible for**:
- Operating System (OS)
- Application software
- Runtime and middleware
- Data and storage management
- Security configurations

**Provider is responsible for**:
- Virtualization
- Physical servers and storage
- Networking
- Data center maintenance

**💡 Use case**: You want full control over your app environment but don’t want to manage hardware.

---

## ⚙️ PaaS (Platform as a Service)

**Customer is responsible for**:
- Application code and logic
- Data input/output
- Scaling of the application (in some cases)

**Provider is responsible for**:
- Runtime and middleware
- OS and infrastructure
- Load balancing and autoscaling
- Backup and patching

**💡 Use case**: You want to focus on app development and not worry about the underlying system setup.

---

## 🧑‍💼 SaaS (Software as a Service)

**Customer is responsible for**:
- Using the software
- Configuring settings and user roles (as per app permissions)

**Provider is responsible for**:
- Everything else: infrastructure, app updates, security, availability, and backups

**💡 Use case**: You just want to use a ready-made solution (like Gmail or Salesforce) with no backend concerns.
